      <description>A colleague asked an intriguing question: &amp;ldquo;what kinda processor are you?&amp;rdquo;. He explained me the classification:
Internal Processor: A person who gives one clear statement after having formulated what to say (including corrections, refinements, etc.) internally External Processor: A person who says something and then goes on making a string of corrections until satisfied &amp;ndash; externally My reply? &amp;ldquo;Iâ€™m an internal processor&amp;hellip; Oh! Wait! I think&amp;hellip; Oh well!&amp;rdquo;. Colleague walks away with a knowing grin ðŸ˜€</description>

      <description>People often start a new endeavour to realise a vivid dream. This is good by itself; the dream coupled with strong self-motivation would take them far when the going gets tough (which it usually does).
However, thereâ€™s another side to dreams thatâ€™s dreadful, particularly for someone starting something new1 and with little experience.
Unrealistic Expectations Itâ€™s no secret; when learning your work wonâ€™t be original, beautiful or fulfilling. Experience shows us that anyoneâ€™s first picture is not far from a scribble.</description>

      <title>Ideating vs Acting</title>

      <description>Ideas Young people are constantly bombarded with free advice by the elderly: people tell them how to talk, how to socialize, how to deal with money matters, etc. Itâ€™s done to the point where itâ€™s felt as preachy and rightly so. Why? More than what you say, kids pick up what you do. Words donâ€™t mean much to them; actions speak much louder indeed.
Even as adults we read motivational text, watch TED talks, discuss problems with friends and get ideas/free advice all the time.</description>

      <title>Life in the Valley</title>

      <description>I lived in Silicon Valley for over a year (2016-18). Like all humans I developed opinions about my new environment; I want to record them under notes-to-self. Before proceeding, I&amp;rsquo;ll lay down the disclaimer: these are just my views and you&amp;rsquo;re totally entitled to your&amp;rsquo;s. Though I try to be reasonable, absolute logic isn&amp;rsquo;t just impractical but is inapplicable since feelings about one&amp;rsquo;s environment are always rooted in emotions, upbringing, habit, etc.</description>

      <description>I have been inspired by many unknown personalities all over the internet and otherwise, but a few linger on my mind consistently to be listed here. Not all of them are authors but their works inspired me in some way.
Kalki R. Krishnamurthy A great writer, and freedom fighter, who effortlessly balanced content against gripping narration. He pioneered in writing under a unique genre &amp;mdash; Historical Fiction &amp;mdash; by mixing imagination with facts in the right amount and proved that it can be done with great success.</description>

      <description>Experience I have been writing on StackOverflow for quite a while now. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if these can be called writing since it&amp;rsquo;s purely technical. However, helping newbies with verbose answers has stoked some confidence in me; confidence that I am good at explaining things to people. Additionally, I recently gave an interactive presentation on a math-heavy topic that garnered good reviews; it took 2 months for me to prepare this slide deck viewable on a browser; more than half the time was spent not on technicalities but on the material.</description>
