      <description>I have been inspired by many unknown personalities all over the internet and otherwise, but a few linger on my mind consistently to be listed here. Not all of them are authors but they work inspired me in some way.
Kalki R. Krishnamurthy A great writer, and freedom fighter, who effortlessly balanced content against gripping narration. He pioneered in writing under a unique genre &amp;mdash; Historical fiction &amp;mdash; by mixing imagination with facts in the right amount and proved that it can be done with great success.</description>

      <description>Experience I have been writing on StackOverflow for quite a while now. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if these can be called writing since it&amp;rsquo;s purely technical. However, helping newbies with verbose answers has stoked some confidence in me; confidence that I am good at explaining things to people. Additionally, I recently gave an interactive presentation on a math-heavy topic that garnered good reviews; it took 2 months for me to prepare this slide deck viewable on a browser; more than half the time was spent not on technicalities but on the material.</description>

      <description>Ideating and/vs Making Say you have a dream of making something; it might be a product, a game or art. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen predominantly two approaches taken. One is to just work on the stuff that matters and rapidly getting closer to what you envisioned in your head; the end product. The emphasis here is specifically not worrying about schedule, design, procedure &amp;mdash; the things that don&amp;rsquo;t actually go into the deliverable, but might make your head feel better.</description>
