      <description>Ideas Young people are constantly bombareded with free advice by the elderly: people tell them how to talk, how to socialize, how to deal with money matters, etc. It’s done to the point where it’s felt as preachy and rightly so. Why? More than what you say, kids pick up what you do. Words don’t mean much to them; actions speak much louder indeed.
Even as adults we read motivational text, watch TED talks, discuss problems with friends and get ideas/free advice all the time.</description>
