I needed to resize both without data loss. I‚Äôd foreseen this and created my Linux partitions using LVM while installing Arch üòá .
Since operations here involve resizing /, boot from Live USB and then perform them. Also make sure the USB is UEFI bootable; otherwise it‚Äôd mean changing BIOS settings to enable Legacy Boot. This may lead to GRUB‚Äôs disappearance from boot menu.</description></item><item><title>Git Wizardry</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/git_nuances/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 19:56:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/git_nuances/</guid><description>Git has its oddities with unusual commands and flags. I keep learning something new every now and then.
A decent understanding of basic Git concepts is a prerequisite.
show time! The easiest way to see the diff introduced by a reference (fancy name for commit) is not git diff!
git show REF # changes introduced in a particular file by a commit git show REF -- path/to/a/file It shows details about the commit along with the changes it brings about.</description></item><item><title>I Git it!</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/git_concepts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2019 19:56:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/git_concepts/</guid><description>Basics like initializing (a repository), staging and commiting files aren‚Äôt explained here; they simply make sense; no ‚ÄòAha!‚Äôs there. Moving references, branching and merging &amp;mdash; coupled with Git‚Äôs arcane command names1 &amp;mdash; are the confusing parts.
Basics Git is a distributed VCS; each repo can be both a server/client Honestly, git (sub)commands are just graph manipulating commands Every codebase is made of a graph; each commit is a node with edges to parent(s)2 Git diagrams often have arrows backwards (‚Üê) for this reason Git stores snapshots not differences i.</description></item><item><title>Emacs Go Setup</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/go_setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jun 2018 07:00:43 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/go_setup/</guid><description>An IDE should at least aid with

Network In the newly installed Arch you might notice that there&amp;rsquo;s no network connectivity.
Ethernet If you just need ethernet/LAN connectivity, just enable what the installation image uses
systemctl enable --now systemd-networkd.service systemctl enable --now systemd-resolved.service You can verify if your preferred network interface is up
ip address show # `UP` inside angle brackets ip link set MY_IFACE_NAME up To enable wireless what you did during installation (see Arch Linux Installation, ¬ß2 Wireless Network).</description></item><item><title>Arch Linux Installation</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/arch_install/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 May 2018 17:00:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/arch_install/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve a dual GPU laptop: Lenovo Legion Y520-15IKBN; the Nvidia GeForce 1050 Ti Mobile for graphics-heavy (3D) tasks and Intel HD Graphics 630 for rendering the rest. It has an SSD and a traditional spinning disk. UEFI + GPT as opposed to the classic BIOS + MBR combo is preferable. I&amp;rsquo;m a long-time Xubuntu user but I wanted to try Arch Linux.

Food!? When you fork1 a repository in GitHub, from your repository&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint, the one you forked from is called the &amp;ldquo;upstream&amp;rdquo;; a term used commonly in the FOSS world for a long time, to denote the original authors (or their repository) of a software. Fork is a concept introduced by GitHub (the code hosting platform) for separation of concerns; Git (the version control system) itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a concept of fork; from its viewpoint, it&amp;rsquo;s just another remote repository.</description></item><item><title>Useful GCC options</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/useful_gcc_opts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:45:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/useful_gcc_opts/</guid><description>Here are some of the useful, but not widely known, options of GCC that I want to document.
GCC Build Specs gcc -dumpspecs Gives the specifications with which GCC was built.
List supported targets gcc --target-help gcc --help=target clang has clang -print-supported-cpus and clang -print-targets similarly. Though clang operates on target triples/quadruples.
On older GCC alternate command is gcc -E -march=help -xc /dev/null.
Stack Usage gcc -fstack-usage Gives the stack usage function-wise for the compiled translation unit; this is helpful in measuring runtime memory usage.</description></item><item><title>Emacs C++ auto-complete on Windows</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/c++_irony_win32/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2017 17:33:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/c++_irony_win32/</guid><description>This note is a guide to setup auto completion for C and C++ modes in Emacs on Windows with minimal manual work. We need Clang, Irony and some Company; we additionally require CMake and MinGW for building something small. Although there are many methods of getting this working, this was the most performant and least time-taking solution for me, so I&amp;rsquo;m documenting it here.
The general installation instructions provided in Irony&amp;rsquo;s README works but it asks you to build the complete Clang compiler from source for a single DLL (libclang.</description></item><item><title>Lua Setup on Windows</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/lua_rocks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2016 17:00:46 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/lua_rocks/</guid><description>Ingredients CMake MinGW compiler (one of MinGW, TDM, MinGW-W64, ‚Ä¶) Lua binaries LuaRocks setup binaries ZeroBrane Studio Steps Involved Make sure the commands cmake and mingw32-gcc are accessible from a general Command Prompt Install CMake; straight-forward Install MinGW64; choose i686-6.2.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev0.

Steps I Still Remember Install Hugo; just extract and put in PATH &amp;mdash; can&amp;rsquo;t be simpler. Create a dummy site using the Quickstart guide; straight forward. Install Ghostwriter inside the themes directory. Hugo recommends that customizations be done outside the theme&amp;rsquo;s directory tree to clearly differentiate customizations. I followed it.

Apart from the prime selling point of content creation from the comfort of your favourite text editor in Markdown, most have a wide gamut of themes to choose from. You are free to remix the theme to your taste however you see fit. Want to change the line spacing and paragraph alignment? Sure thing! Don&amp;rsquo;t like anything?
