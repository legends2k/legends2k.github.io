This is my cheat sheet for my oft-used functions. There’s also a printable, broad-coverage official reference card (PDF). True to Emacs’ documenting tradition, the manual documents all features extensively, with examples too.

Pen drives use flash memory while SSDs use solid state storage. SSDs can be interfaced with your mobo1 either through SATA or PCIe; M.2 is actually a form factor (standard stating about the size and form of such drives which are small and rectangular; looks like RAM modules compared to the 2.5 inch drives), connecting to your mobo via PCIe with the logical interface options of AHCI (legacy) or NVMe.</description></item><item><title>Primary Key across Tables</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/pkey_across_tables/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 17:34:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/pkey_across_tables/</guid><description>Problem At times we might need uniqueness constraint for a common column across tables. Let’s say we’ve a bunch of products a retailer sells e.g. books, toys and dresses. Each item-kind needs its own table as they’ll have different inherent properties e.g. {author, pages} for books, {weight, colour} for toys and {material, fit} for dress.
We’ve two requirements business-wise:
A unique item code is needed to identify every product All of these items show up on the same invoice If we adhere to third normal form, we’ll have tables like</description></item><item><title>Advent of Code Experience</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/aoc_2018/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2022 19:55:57 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/aoc_2018/</guid><description>I completed Advent of Code (AoC) 2018 today. It’s a puzzle jam: yearly from Dec 1 to 25 a couple of puzzles are published everyday. It’s popular in geek circles; folks solve them in winter when business is dull. Leaderboards are filled with people who solve them well within the release day. There aren’t any restrictions on when or how you solve these puzzles.

Runtime problems: situations programmer foresaw and handled; expected. E.g. invalid inputs, no access to resource, unreachable network, … Bugs: programmer mistakes; unexpected. E.g. buffer overflow, access violation, … There are different tools to deal with each; don’t conflate one with the other.
An assertion is just a validation of a programmer expectation; it “fires” when the expectation is betrayed.
(1) is familiar to most; use one of your language-provided feature including if, try-catch-throw, etc.</description></item><item><title>Computer Graphics Resouces</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/cg_resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 16:08:36 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/cg_resources/</guid><description>Here’s a curated list of learning resources I usually recommend for self-studying the domain of Computer Graphics.
Learning graphics concepts isn’t the same as learning a rendering library; the latter is usually not very beneficial since a new library eventually replaces/takes over. Strive to learn the theory behind the domain, not the tools or their idiosyncrasies. Once you internalize the basic ideas, try doing some CG projects with increasing hardness.</description></item><item><title>Hacker Culture</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/hacker_culture/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 18:40:53 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/hacker_culture/</guid><description>You can’t learn everything from scratch practically; you need to stand on the shoulder of giants.

I just want to use it as a server. Thanks to Raspbian for providing a simple way to auto-enable SSH on boot!

I needed to resize both without data loss. I’d foreseen this and created my Linux partitions using LVM while installing Arch 😇 .
Since operations here involve resizing /, boot from Live USB and then perform them. Also make sure the USB is UEFI bootable; otherwise it’d mean changing BIOS settings to enable Legacy Boot. This may lead to GRUB’s disappearance from boot menu.</description></item><item><title>Improving Programmer Kata</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/programmer_kata/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 12:59:50 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/programmer_kata/</guid><description>Becoming a good programmer doesn’t happen in a day.
Like most fields, you need grit more than intelligence/smartness.
Guidelines Write small toy programs to prove yourself right / wrong It’s easy to get lost in the details of a large project; it’s just noise A toy program is a simple way of filtering signal from noise Document what you learn Sprinkle enough comments; they&amp;rsquo;ll help you later Write markdown articles with references for involved topics Always RTFM Mark of a good engineer: ability to digest design, API documentation or books Grok documentation and articles written by better programmers Keep a repository handy This should have all your workouts, big or small Usable any where without installing big tool chains Preferably plain text; searchable readily with omnipresent tools grep and find Write something substantial &amp;ndash; a mini-project Professionally most programmers are just cogs in a large wheel Authoring a small project end-to-end leads to much deeper insights Great tools like ripgrep are hobby projects Scope your project Start with something small and tangible Have something working in a week If not, you&amp;rsquo;re biting more than you could chew scope down or burn out Be consistent Work on your pet project at least an hour a day An hour isn&amp;rsquo;t much &amp;ndash; usually total wasted minutes/day is more Trick: small, incremental changes every day; don’t lose steam Write cross-platform and cross toolchain code Makes you a better programmer Standards-adhering code has longevity and better portability Widens user base Have a reliable toolchain setup Use the same set of tools everywhere (across platforms) Improves muscle memory; kata Sticking to a same set of tools lets them not get in your way; productivity Examples: coreutils, findutils, binutils, Emacs, Vim, etc.</description></item><item><title>Git Wizardry</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/git_nuances/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 19:56:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/git_nuances/</guid><description>Git has its oddities with unusual commands and flags.

Moving references, branching and merging &amp;mdash; coupled with Git’s arcane command names1 &amp;mdash; are the confusing parts.
Basics Git is a distributed VCS; each repo can be both a server/client Honestly, git (sub)commands are just graph manipulating commands Every codebase is made of a graph; each commit is a node with edges to parent(s)2 Git diagrams often have arrows backwards (←) for this reason Git stores snapshots not differences i.</description></item><item><title>GRUB Recovery</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/grub2_recovery/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 18:35:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/grub2_recovery/</guid><description>I tried upgrading the firmware of my old iOmega 1 TB HDD.

C++ is vast. If you’re beginning to learn it, the internet has enough discouraging words. Just start learning instead of reading about it i.e. don’t learn about C++, learn C++. The innumerable topics might be daunting, but don’t worry. Knowing a few concepts will get you productive.

Food!? When you fork1 a repository in GitHub, from your repository&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint, the one you forked from is called the &amp;ldquo;upstream&amp;rdquo;; a term used commonly in the FOSS world for a long time, to denote the original authors (or their repository) of a software. Fork is a concept introduced by GitHub (the code hosting platform) for separation of concerns; Git (the version control system) itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a concept of fork; from its viewpoint, it&amp;rsquo;s just another remote repository.</description></item><item><title>Useful GCC options</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/useful_gcc_opts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:45:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/useful_gcc_opts/</guid><description>Here are some of the useful, but not widely known, options of GCC I use periodically.
