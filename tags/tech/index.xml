      <description>Becoming a senior programmer/engineer doesn’t happen in a day.
 Like most skills, often you need grit than intelligence/smartness.
 Guidelines  Write small toy programs to prove yourself right / wrong  It’s easy to get lost in the details of a large project; however it’s just noise A toy programs is a simple way of filtering signal from noise   Document what you learn  Sprinkle enough comments; they&amp;rsquo;ll help you later Write markdown articles for involved topics   Keep a repository handy  This should have all your workouts, big or small It used be usable any where without installing big tool chains Preferably plain text; searchable readily with omnipresent tools grep and find   Write something substantial &amp;ndash; a mini-project  Professionally most programmers are just cogs in a large wheel Authoring a small project end-to-end leads to much deeper insights   Scope  Start with something small and tangible Not having something decent in a week is a sign You&amp;rsquo;re biting more than you could chew, cut back   Always RTFM  Mark of a good engineer: ability to digest design, API documentation or books Grok documentation and articles written by better programmers   Be consistent  Work on your pet project at least an hour a day An hour isn&amp;rsquo;t much &amp;ndash; consider the minutes that go wasted in a day Trick: small, incremental changes every day; don’t lose steam   Write cross-platform and cross toolchain code  It makes you a better programmer Code adhering to standards has longevity and better portability Widens user base   Toolchain  Use the same set of tools everywhere (across platforms) Improves muscle memory Sticking to a same set of tools lets tools not get in your way Examples: coreutils, findutils, binutils, Emacs, Vim, etc.</description>

      <description>Git has its oddities with unusual commands and flags. I keep learning something new every now and then.
A decent understanding of basic Git concepts is a prerequisite.
show time! The easiest way to see the diff introduced by a reference (fancy name for commit) is not git diff!
git show REF It shows details about the commit along with the changes it brings about. Of course, you can control the amount of information thrown at you with the usual options show shares with log: --name-status, --shortstat, --stat, --summary, etc.</description>

      <description>I had a great first experience participating in a game jam &amp;ndash; 5th Alakajam. A three-day game jam where we1 wrote a primitive, real-time tactical strategy game: Sneak Out. The game is playable within a browser, thanks to raylib and WebAssembly.
 Sneak Out! from within the browser
  I’m a person with a decent degree of analysis paralysis. A code jam was the perfect antidote to kick me out of my rut!</description>

      <description>Basics like initializing (a repository), staging and commiting files aren’t explained here; they simply make sense; no ‘Aha!’s there. Moving references, branching and merging &amp;mdash; coupled with Git’s arcane command names1 &amp;mdash; are the confusing parts.
Basics  Git is a distributed VCS; each repo can be both a server/client Honestly, git (sub)commands are just graph manipulating commands Every codebase is made of a graph; each commit is a node with edges to parent(s)2  Git diagrams often have arrows backwards (←) for this reason   Git stores snapshots not differences i.</description>

      <description>I tried upgrading the firmware of my old iOmega 1 TB HDD. Internally it’s a Barracuda LP family, ST31000520AS model Segate HDD. Seagate had released a firmware upgrade for this drive in 2010. I’m around 9 years late to the party!
My laptop doesn’t have a CD-ROM drive, also I prefer burning the ISO to a USB stick &amp;mdash; why waste a CD, eh? Rufus kindly refused as the supplied Seagate update ISO’s boot format was unrecognizable.</description>

      <description>Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out. — Bjarne Stroustrup
 C++ is vast. If you’re beginning to learn it, the internet has enough discouraging words. Just start learning instead of reading about it i.e. don’t learn about C++, learn C++. The innumerable topics might be daunting, but don’t worry. Knowing a few concepts will get you productive. More than the actual content, this article aims to give you keywords of that set, so that you can pursue them further.</description>

      <description>An IDE at least should do
 Auto-completion (a.k.a Intellisense) Jump to definition On-the-fly error checks Context-sensitive document lookup  Show variable and function type Show function description   Autorun gofmt on save Bonus: Auto-add/remove used/unused packages on file save  We’ll try to get these going on Emacs.
External Tools Though not part of the canonical tool set, these are written by seasoned Go devs
 gocode godef goflymake goimports godoc  Emacs Packages We’d be needing these too to interface with above tools</description>

      <description>See Arch Linux Installation for installation notes.
Network In the newly installed Arch you might notice that there&amp;rsquo;s no network connectivity. To enable do what you did during installation (see Arch Linux Installation, §2 Wireless Network). I did it only to realize, for netctl to hook to a WPA-secured network, the wpa_supplicant package is needed but was absent on the installed system. To connect to the internet, you need a package from the internet!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve a dual GPU laptop: Lenovo Legion Y520-15IKBN; the Nvidia GeForce 1050 Ti Mobile for graphics-heavy (3D) tasks and Intel HD Graphics 630 for rendering the rest. It has an SSD and a traditional spinning disk. UEFI + GPT as opposed to the classic BIOS + MBR combo is preferable. I&amp;rsquo;m a long-time Xubuntu user but I wanted to try Arch Linux. Here I note my experience in getting this laptop up and running.</description>

      <description>I believe resistance is futile if someone is bent on spying on you; there’re both serious and creative ways to go about it. Talking to your processor, behind your back, isn’t the primary or only means. Our’s is a golden age where corporates and government agencies stoop low enough to pry into bedrooms. Did you know that almost all machines1 you own have a processor aside from the one you paid for?</description>

      <title>Git: Pushing to a Fork</title>
      <link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/push_fork/</link>

      <guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/push_fork/</guid>
      <description>Fork? Food!? When you fork1 a repository in GitHub, from your repository&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint, the one you forked from is called the &amp;ldquo;upstream&amp;quot;; a term used commonly in the FOSS world for a long time, to denote the original authors (or their repository) of a software. Fork is a concept introduced by GitHub (the code hosting platform) for separation of concerns; Git (the version control system) itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a concept of fork; from its viewpoint, it&amp;rsquo;s just another remote repository.</description>

      <description>Here are some of the useful, but not widely known, options of GCC that I want to document.
GCC Build Specs gcc -dumpspecs Gives the specifications with which GCC was built.
Stack Usage gcc -fstack-usage Gives the stack usage function-wise for the compiled translation unit; this is helpful in measuring runtime memory usage. See the manual for details on deciphering its output.
Macros and Include Directories # get macros defined when the language is C++ cpp -xc++ -dM /dev/null # get macros defined when the language is C cpp -dM /dev/null Prints the macros defined when the preprocessor was called.</description>

      <description>This note is a guide to setup auto completion for C and C++ modes in Emacs on Windows with minimal manual work. We need Clang, Irony and some Company; we additionally require CMake and MinGW for building something small. Although there are many methods of getting this working, this was the most performant and least time-taking solution for me, so I&amp;rsquo;m documenting it here.
The general installation instructions provided in Irony&amp;rsquo;s README works but it asks you to build the complete Clang compiler from source for a single DLL (libclang.</description>

      <description>I did quite a few things to get this blog up and running the way you see it now.
Steps I Still Remember  Install Hugo; just extract and put in PATH &amp;mdash; can&amp;rsquo;t be simpler. Create a dummy site using the Quickstart guide; straight forward. Install Ghostwriter inside the themes directory.  Hugo recommends that customizations be done outside the theme&amp;rsquo;s directory tree to clearly differentiate customizations. I followed it.</description>

      <description>Many static site generators are coming up these days; 175 and still counting. Apart from the prime selling point of content creation from the comfort of your favourite text editor in Markdown, most have a wide gamut of themes to choose from. You are free to remix the theme to your taste however you see fit. Want to change the line spacing and paragraph alignment? Sure thing! Don&amp;rsquo;t like anything? Ditch them all and whip up something new.</description>
