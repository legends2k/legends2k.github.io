Pen drives use flash memory while SSDs use solid state storage. SSDs can be interfaced with your mobo1 either through SATA or PCIe; M.2 is actually a form factor (standard stating about the size and form of such drives which are small and rectangular; looks like RAM modules compared to the 2.5 inch drives), connecting to your mobo via PCIe with the logical interface options of AHCI (legacy) or NVMe.</description></item><item><title>Resize root under LVM</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/lvm_resize/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 07:36:47 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/lvm_resize/</guid><description>My root partition had unused space while /home was starving. I needed to resize both without data loss. Iâ€™d foreseen this and created my Linux partitions using LVM while installing Arch ðŸ˜‡ .
Since operations here involve resizing /, boot from Live USB and then perform them. Also make sure the USB is UEFI bootable; otherwise itâ€™d mean changing BIOS settings to enable Legacy Boot. This may lead to GRUBâ€™s disappearance from boot menu.</description></item><item><title>GRUB Recovery</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/grub2_recovery/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 18:35:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/grub2_recovery/</guid><description>I tried upgrading the firmware of my old iOmega 1 TB HDD. Internally itâ€™s a Barracuda LP family, ST31000520AS model Segate HDD. Seagate had released a firmware upgrade for this drive in 2010. Iâ€™m around 9 years late to the party!
My laptop doesnâ€™t have a CD-ROM drive, also I prefer burning the ISO to a USB stick &amp;mdash; why waste a CD, eh? Rufus kindly refused as the supplied Seagate update ISOâ€™s boot format was unrecognizable.</description></item><item><title>Arch Linux Configuration</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/arch_config/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2019 11:31:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/arch_config/</guid><description>See Arch Linux Installation for installation notes.
Network In the newly installed Arch you might notice that there&amp;rsquo;s no network connectivity.
Wireless To enable wireless do what you did during installation (see Arch Linux Installation, Â§2 Wireless Network). I did it only to realize, for netctl to hook to a WPA-secured network, the wpa_supplicant package is needed but was absent on the installed system. To connect to the internet, you need a package from the internet!</description></item><item><title>Arch Linux Installation</title><link>https://legends2k.github.io/note/arch_install/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 May 2018 17:00:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://legends2k.github.io/note/arch_install/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve a dual GPU laptop: Lenovo Legion Y520-15IKBN; the Nvidia GeForce 1050 Ti Mobile for graphics-heavy (3D) tasks and Intel HD Graphics 630 for rendering the rest. It has an SSD and a traditional spinning disk. UEFI + GPT as opposed to the classic BIOS + MBR combo is preferable. I&amp;rsquo;m a long-time Xubuntu user but I wanted to try Arch Linux. Here I note my experience in getting this laptop up and running.</description></item></channel></rss>
