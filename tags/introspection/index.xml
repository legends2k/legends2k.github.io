      <description>I completed Advent of Code (AoC) 2018 today. It’s a puzzle jam: yearly from Dec 1 to 25 a couple of puzzles are published everyday. It’s popular in geek circles; folks solve them in winter when business is dull. Leaderboards are filled with people who solve them well within the release day. There aren’t any restrictions on when or how you solve these puzzles.
This piece shares my experience for the general computer programmer.</description>

      <description>I had a great first experience participating in a game jam &amp;ndash; 5th Alakajam. A three-day game jam where we1 wrote a primitive, real-time tactical strategy game: Sneak Out. The game is playable within a browser, thanks to raylib and WebAssembly.
Sneak Out! from within the browser
I’m a person with a decent degree of analysis paralysis. A code jam was the perfect antidote to kick me out of my rut!</description>
