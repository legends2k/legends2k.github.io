      <description>Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out. — Bjarne Stroustrup
 C++ is vast. If you’re beginning to learn it, the internet has enough discouraging words. Just start learning instead of reading about it i.e. don’t learn about C++, learn C++. The innumerable topics might be daunting, but don’t worry. Knowing a few concepts will get you productive. More than the actual content, this article aims to give you keywords of that set, so that you can pursue them further.</description>

      <description>An IDE at least should do
 Auto-completion (a.k.a Intellisense) Jump to definition On-the-fly error checks Context-sensitive document lookup  Show variable and function type Show function description  Autorun gofmt on save Bonus: Auto-add/remove used/unused packages on file save  We’ll try to get these going on Emacs.
External Tools Though not part of the canonical tool set, these are written by seasoned Go devs
 gocode godef goflymake goimports godoc  Emacs Packages We’d be needing these too to interface with above tools</description>

      <description>This note is a guide to setup auto completion for C and C++ modes in Emacs on Windows with minimal manual work. We need Clang, Irony and some Company; we additionally require CMake and MinGW for building something small. Although there are many methods of getting this working, this was the most performant and least time-taking solution for me, so I&amp;rsquo;m documenting it here.
The general installation instructions provided in Irony&amp;rsquo;s README works but it asks you to build the complete Clang compiler from source for a single DLL (libclang.</description>

Both archive and installer works. mingw-w64 project&amp;rsquo;s MinGW only has gcc.exe while luarocks expects mingw32-gcc.exe; create a symbolic link (mklink)  Download lua-5.3.3_Win32_bin.zip from LuaForge Lua Binaries project  Make sure Lua and MinGW are of the same arch This contains the binaries (.</description>
