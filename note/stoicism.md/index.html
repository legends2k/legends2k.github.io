Eudaimonia
: Happy and smooth flowing life.  The core of the stoic triangle.  The ultimate goal of life that all ancient philosophies agreed on: living a thriving life.

**Living with Areté[^fn1]**
: Express your highest self in every moment.  If we want to be on good terms with our highest self, we need to close the gap between what we’re capable of and what we’re actually doing.  This is really about being your best version in the here and now.

**Focus on What You Control**
: This is the most prominent principle in Stoicism.  At all times, we need to focus on the things we control, and take the rest as it happens.  What already is has to be accepted because it’s beyond our power to undo it.  What’s beyond our power is ultimately not important for our flourishing.  What's important for our flourishing is what we choose to do with the given external circumstances.

**Take Responsibility**
: Good and bad come solely from yourself.  This follows the first two corner's that say external things don’t matter for the good life, so living with areté, which is within your control, is enough to flourish in life.  Also, you’re responsible for your life because every external event you don’t control offers an area you can control, namely how you choose to respond to this event.  This is crucial in Stoicism, it’s not events that make us happy or miserable, but our interpretation of those events.  A tower of strength is born the moment you decide to give outside events no power over you.


# Live with Areté

> "A good character is the only guarantee of everlasting, carefree happiness"
>   -- Seneca

This perfect actualization of our highest selves might not be too hard to express in single situations or in our imagination, but drag us out in the real world and we fail miserably.  And that’s ok, that’s what we’re here for, learning about ourselves and how to express our highest version moment to moment to moment.

Think of areté or virtue as a form of wisdom or strength that helps you do the appropriate thing at all times, so that your actions are in harmony with your highest self—courageous, disciplined, and kind for example.  Virtue is what helps you close the gap between what you’re actually doing and what you’re capable of.  The bigger that gap, the further away you are from eudaimonia.

The Stoics believed that nature wants us to thrive in life.  This is why the inner daimon, our highest self, had been planted within all of us like a divine seed, so that we have it in our natural potential to become that highest version of ourselves.  To be virtuous, then, is to live as nature designed us to live. This is where the Stoic aphorism living in agreement with nature comes from.  An example from nature: natural potential of a grape seed is to grow into a grapevine and bear grapes.  So a grape seed lives with areté or in _agreement with nature_ when it fulfils its natural potential by growing into a grapevine and producing grapes.

Is it even possible to be the best we can be in every moment?  Maybe not.  This is why the Stoics used the Sage as an ideal, because there are no perfect humans.  And we don't need to be perfect for the Stoics, but we can at least try to be as good as possible.

> "What happens to us is nature’s treatment to become better people.  Those things happen for us, not against us, even if it doesn’t seem so."
>   — Marcus Aurelius

## Attention (_prosoche_)

Attention is the fundamental Stoic spiritual attitude.

If we want to be the best we can be in every situation, if we want to live with areté, then we need to be aware of our every step e.g. walking barefoot along the beach when suddenly a section is full of bits of broken glass. Now you walk very cautiously and watch every step like a hawk so you don’t hurt yourself— that's the attention the Stoics want us to pay to every action.

Focused attention and continuous self-observation is necessary if we actively want to align our actions with virtue, for how could we make sure we act virtuously if we weren't even aware of our actions?

> "Every hour focus your mind attentively on the performance of the task in hand, with dignity, human sympathy, benevolence and freedom, and leave aside all other thoughts.  You will achieve this, if you perform each action as if it were your last."
>   -- Marcus Aurelius

# Focus on What You Control

Accept Whatever Happens and Make the Best of It.

> "Of things some are in our power, and others are not."
>   -- Epictetus

**Stoic dichotomy of control** -- some things are up to us, other things are not -- it’s really about the recognition of three levels of influence we have over the world:
  - **High influence**: Our choices in judgments and actions
  - **Partial influence**: Health, wealth, relationships, and outcomes of our behaviours
  - **No influence**: Weather, ethnicity, and most external circumstances

> "God, grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, The Courage to change the things I can, And the Wisdom to know the difference."
>   -- The Serenity Prayer

Who is there to prevent you being good and sincere?  We are the only ones to stop ourselves from cultivating these qualities.  It’s within our power to prevent viciousness, curb our arrogance, stop lusting after fame, and control our temper.  "Do you not see how many virtues you can display without any excuse of lack of talent or aptitude? Or does the fact that you have no inborn talent oblige you to grumble, toady, or blame?"  No it does not!  It’s within our power to choose our behavior, even if everything else is not or only partially within our control.

## Process focus

To focus on the process (under our control), instead of the desired outcome (not under our control).

Stoics realized that the process will affect the outcome.  The process is about our behavior, deliberate practice, and all that prepares us to shoot well.

Success, then, is defined by our effort to do everything that's within our power.  Whether we hit the target or not, whether we win or lose, whether we drop some weight or not, ultimately does not matter. We succeed or fail already in the process.  So the Stoic archer focuses on the process (preparing and shooting well); a possible positive outcome (hitting the target) won’t arouse jubilation, and a possible negative outcome (missing the target) won’t arouse despair.  The Stoic archer succeeds in the process and is ready to take any outcome with equanimity and calm confidence, knowing they’ve tried their very best.

The Stoics highlighted that anxiety and inner disturbance come from wanting things out of our control.  Epictetus, for example, said that it’s foolish to want friends and relatives to live forever because it’s not up to us.  As seen before, the root cause of emotional suffering comes from worrying about things outside our control.  This is why we should focus on the process; the process is fully under our control.

## Acceptance

_Enjoy the ride or get dragged_ -- a dog leashed to a moving cart has two options: smoothly follow the cart’s direction or stubbornly resist and still end up going in the cart’s direction.  Acquiescence is a key quality.

Whenever we desire something that isn't in our power, our tranquility and confidence will be disturbed; if we don’t get what we want, we’ll be upset, and if we do get what we want, we’ll experience anxiety and insecurity in the process of getting it as we can never be sure we’ll get it.  Therefore, we should always focus on what is up to us; that way we won’t blame others, won’t resent life.  That’s where much of the power of Stoicism comes from.  The internalization of this basic truth that we can control our actions but not their outcomes makes us confident because we have given all that was in our power, and this confidence lets us calmly accept whatever happens.

Focus on what you control, and take the rest as it happens.  The rest is not under your control, that’s why the Stoics advise to accept it even if it’s not pleasing.  Accept it first, and then try to make the best out of it. We should accept rather than fight every little thing.

> "To get upset by things is to wrongly assume that they will last, [and] to resent change is to wrongly assume that you have a choice in the matter."
>   -- Ryan Holiday

# Take Responsibility

This is a process goal.  The Stoics did not focus on the future outcome (a happy life) but on the process in the present moment (living with arete) that should ultimately lead to the wished outcome.  This focus on the process is what makes us, as aspiring Stoics, ultimately responsible for our own flourishing because we’re in control of that process.  While the outcome can be prevented by external events, the process and our intentions are completed in the present moment and cannot be prevented by anything outside our control.

> "The wise man looks to the purpose of all actions, not their consequences; beginnings are in our power but Fortune judges the outcome, and I do not grant her a verdict upon me."
>    -- Seneca

Stoicism teaches that we’re very much responsible for our own happiness as well as unhappiness.  It also teaches that taking this responsibility will improve our chances of attaining eudaimonia.  The _victim mentality_ -- blaming external circumstances for our unhappiness -- on the other hand, will make the happy life an impossible goal to reach.

We must refuse to let the hands we’re dealt decide over our wellbeing.  The Stoics say that outside events and other people may have the power to affect how and even whether you live, but they don’t have the power to ruin our lives.  Only you yourself can ruin your life by getting jerked around by things you don’t control and by failing to act as well as you’re capable of.

> "Everything can be taken from a man but one tiling; the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances."
>   -- _Man’s Search for Meaning_

## Reasoned Choice

Don’t react.

# Practicality

## Brace Yourself

What would have become of any person you admire without any struggles?  Your mom?  That colleague you rate so highly?  Roger Federer or any other superstar?

One thing is sure, they wouldn’t be where they are without the challenges they surely faced in their lives.  Difficulties are important.  That’s what we’re here for.

> "God does not make a spoiled pet of a good man; he tests him, hardens him, and fits him for his own service."
>   -- Seneca

## Be Mindful

The most important prerequisite is to be aware of what’s going on.  Because Stoic philosophy is a lot about how we react to what happens in the world around us.

“A consciousness of wrongdoing is the first step to salvation,” Seneca says. “You have to catch yourself doing it before you can correct it.”

Stoicism asks of us to be aware of what we do in every moment.  The whole idea of virtue, to express our highest self in every moment, is based on our ability to be present in the moment and know what’s going on.

## Do, Don’t Say

The simplest trick to make sure nobody will mock you

> "On no occasion call yourself a philosopher, and do not, for the most part, talk among laymen about your philosophical principles, but rather do what follows from your principles."
>    -- Epictetus

Don’t mention that you’re into Stoicism, just live by it.
