Itâ€™s a puzzle jam: yearly from Dec 1 to 25 a couple of puzzles are published everyday. Itâ€™s <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?q=advent+of+code">popular</a> in geek circles; folks solve them in winter when business is dull. Leaderboards are filled with people who solve them well within the release day. There arenâ€™t any restrictions on when or how you solve these puzzles.</p><p>This piece shares my experience for the general computer programmer.</p><h1 id=code>Code</h1><p>I used <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/>Rust</a> but that isnâ€™t the subject of this article. Hereâ€™s my repo:</p><p><a href=https://github.com/legends2k/advent-of-code/tree/master/2018>https://github.com/legends2k/advent-of-code/tree/master/2018</a></p><p>Iâ€™ve peppered the code with enough comments. My commit logs usually capture context which canâ€™t be added as comments.</p><p>I donâ€™t like shortcuts like hard-coding puzzle inputs, keeping everything as strings, etc. I tried to make the code fast, within reason, by being disciplined. <strong>Iâ€™ve tried my best to make everything structured without <a href=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving>yak shaving</a></strong>.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/legends2k/advent-of-code/issues/new>Raise a bug</a> if you want to discuss something.</p><h1 id=history>History</h1><p>I motivated a couple of friends to join me in trying AoC around 2020 Feb. <strong>Little did we know about the then-imminent pandemic</strong>. A month from our start weâ€™re deep in lock-downs, procuring grocery like paramilitary, setting up home offices and mini-schools, &mldr;</p><p>We agreed on completing one puzzle/week since weâ€™re married with kids. We thought itâ€™s a reasonable target given these puzzles are solved in a day by so many. How wrong were we! ðŸ¤£</p><p><strong>Nevertheless we ploughed whenever we got free time.</strong></p><h1 id=complete-em>Complete &rsquo;em!</h1><blockquote><p>How fast you complete the puzzles doesnâ€™t matter much than the completion itself.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Iâ€™ve no shame in admitting it took 2Â½ years for me to complete what people do in 25 days. Iâ€™m glad I completed them</strong>. I didnâ€™t have a regular schedule since life intervened, multiple times (some quite serious like death, relocation, etc. apart from the pandemic). <strong>Whenever I found time, I solved small parts</strong> of a puzzle. For instance, parsing the input itself was quite a challenge for <a href=#day-24>a puzzle</a>, I took a couple of days (an hour each) and solved it.</p><p>Maintaining perspective is important as always. If Iâ€™m doing it for fun (and knowledge), whatâ€™s the point in trying to rush with a false deadline and pressurize myself? The other extreme is to be so lax I lose interest and not complete. While thereâ€™s nothing inherently wrong about this, repeating this for all my endeavours will leave me a bunch of unfinished projects; with mediocre to no proficiency in any language/tool/concept. Let aside mastery, Iâ€™d not have stories to tell or experiences to gain with that style of working.</p><p><strong>The balance is to complete the project at your own pace while preventing burn outs.</strong></p><h1 id=cheating-to-learn>Cheating to learn</h1><p>I completed <em>almost</em> all puzzles on my own. IIRC, I cheated for 2-3 puzzles; looked up someoneâ€™s solution. Itâ€™s important to know when:</p><blockquote><p>I cheated when all other options are exhausted and I realized Iâ€™m stuck long enough on one puzzle to lose interest in AoC.</p></blockquote><p>Since many had solved AoC 2018 by now, I looked around the forums (<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode>r/adventofcode</a>), scoured Wikipedia articles on a data structures / algorithms and discussed with friends. When I realized all my usual options led me nowhere, I turned to someoneâ€™s solution. I didnâ€™t read them directly. I usually ran them with my puzzle inputs and checked the correct answer against mine. This helped me solve a puzzle without cheating.</p><p>Cheating instead of dropping the project altogether seems okay. Itâ€™s okay if youâ€™re doing it for learning; not when youâ€™re proving your worth (e.g. exam).</p><h1 id=takeaways>Takeaways</h1><ol><li>Developer time is more valuable than machine time<ul><li>Some solutions I encountered took 10x more time to solve the same puzzle, but with a simpler approach and perhaps considerably lesser dev time. Moreover, their actual runtime were in minutes while I spent days to arrive at my optimized structured solution.</li></ul></li><li>Brute force solutions arenâ€™t as bad as you might think<ul><li>Sometimes theyâ€™re the optimal solution given other parameters</li><li>Optimized solutions have poor ROI at times [relates to (1)]</li></ul></li><li>Excessive polishing is a waste of time<ul><li>Know when to stop; understand the <em>Law of Diminishing Returns</em></li></ul></li><li>Code regularly periodically to avoid becoming a rusty developer; important as you become a senior<ul><li>Corporates donâ€™t care about your coding skills, only results</li></ul></li><li>There are many awesome programmers out there; learn and admire<ul><li>Iâ€™m humbled by some solutions I encountered</li></ul></li></ol><h1 id=references>References</h1><p>After solving every puzzle, Iâ€™d fun going over solutions particularly of of Kanegae Gabriel and Andrew Gallant. Respect and admiration for their work.</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/KanegaeGabriel/advent-of-code-2018>Kanegae Gabriel</a> (Python)</li><li><a href=https://github.com/BurntSushi/advent-of-code>Andrew Gallant</a> a.k.a <em>BurntSushi</em> (Rust)</li><li><a href=https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/solving-advent-of-code-in-under-a-second/>Forrest Smith</a> (Rust)</li><li><a href=https://todd.ginsberg.com/tags/adventofcode/>Todd Ginsberg</a> (Kotlin)</li></ul><h1 id=rust>Rust</h1><p>I solved the puzzles in Rust. Itâ€™s common for participants of AoC to pick a new language they wanted to get better at as the tool to solving the puzzles. Iâ€™d been dabbling in Rust for more than 3 years now; done some <a href=https://github.com/legends2k/exercism/tree/master/rust>Rust exercises</a>; presented Rust sessions at my office. Wanting to improve my <a href=/note/programmer_kata/>kata</a> is only part reason. I knew <em>BurntSushi</em>, author of <a href=https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep>ripgrep</a>, has done AoC 2018; I wanted to compare my solutions to his after every puzzle completion ;)</p><p>I wrote functional-style Rust using iterators wherever possible; itâ€™s terse and sound coding. Thanks to <a href=https://exercism.org/tracks/rust>Exercism.io</a> for teaching this early on.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span style=display:flex><span>box_ids

More importantly, Iâ€™m now confident enough to reach for Rust when itâ€™s the right tool. Iâ€™ve learned a bunch of concepts, techniques and standard library facilities I can employ in other projects. I still have to learn about async, generics, etc. (unneeded for AoC). Itâ€™s nice to have such backlogs to pursue.</p><h1 id=puzzles>Puzzles</h1><p>This is the last section for a couple of reasons: (a) maybe uninteresting to non-participants (b) contains spoilers.</p><p>Some puzzles were very dry; questions werenâ€™t very good at explaining the problem<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. This was frustrating since the rules werenâ€™t properly laid out.</p><p>Hereâ€™re some notable puzzles and my learnings:</p><h2 id=day-6>Day 6</h2><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram>Voronoi diagram</a> calculation problem. Involved coding up <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill>flood fill</a>-like algorithm.</p><h2 id=day-7>Day 7</h2><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)>Task scheduler</a> puzzle involving a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph>dependency graph</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting>topological sort</a>. I solved this using a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array>dynamic array</a> (<code>Vec</code>) instead of a graph. I did this by storing the dependants of a task, instead of its dependencies, and followed a push, instead of pull, model on task completions.</p><p>Learned about authoring custom iterators in Rust.</p><h2 id=day-9>Day 9</h2><p>Computing hi-scores in a game between elves. Wrote a <code>CircularList</code> using <code>Vec</code>. Many solved this using <code>HashMap</code> but simple <code>Vec</code> is fairly versatile and under-used. <code>:)</code></p><h2 id=day-10>Day 10</h2><p>Points move around on an infinitely large canvas frame-by-frame; at a point in time they form a bunch of characters just for a frame. I wrote a 2D visualization to solve this but it doesnâ€™t stop at the right frame; Iâ€™d to watch and manually pause the simulation at the right frame. I didnâ€™t realize the bounding box of the entire data keeps shrinking and reaches its minimum when the characters are formed!</p><p>My interests in graphics and game programming biased me to take this (non-optimal) my approach. A good learning exercise.</p><p><em>This was my longest hiatus</em>: resumed AoC after a 10 month break.</p><h2 id=day-11>Day 11</h2><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table>Summed area table</a> problem which I realized only after solving it using a semi-brute force approach.</p><h2 id=day-12>Day 12</h2><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm>Genetic algorithm</a> puzzle on plant growth. Using bit flags was fun! <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation>Bit fiddling</a> is becoming a lost art these days; it isnâ€™t esoteric once you understand the basics and itâ€™s fast.</p><p>This is the start of puzzles where solutions can get stuck in infinite loops without a deterministic answer. Iâ€™d to bail out of a loop if solutions didnâ€™t change across iterations.</p><h2 id=day-13>Day 13</h2><p>Fun problem with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art>ASCII art</a> input of carts spread across a map. Itâ€™s a simulation of carts moving around to check an eventual collision. A very satisfying problem!</p><h2 id=day-15>Day 15</h2><p>Mini <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turns,_rounds_and_time-keeping_systems_in_games#Turn-based>turn-based</a> battle. I gathered from the forums that many folks stopped AoC 2018 at this one. It needs implementing <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem>shortest distance</a> path finding and meticulously follow a set of rules to find the victor.</p><p>I implemented BFS-based pathing. The puzzle itself wasnâ€™t hard (skill-wise) but involved a lot of busy work. Though I struggled quite a bit, Iâ€™m proud I solved it without help.</p><p>Day 14 was the start of poor puzzle descriptions. Day 15 was longer, more complicated and unclear.</p><h2 id=day-16>Day 16</h2><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine>Virtual machine</a> implementation running ElfCode, a made-up <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture>instruction set</a>. This was fun! VM created here is used in later puzzles with more complications. It roused the assembly programmer in me; it all came back!</p><h2 id=day-17>Day 17</h2><p>A simulation of liquid flow filling reservoirs. This was quite hard. My continuous approach was futile; resorted to a discrete approach and solved it.</p><p>Unlike most mine was an iterative solution but super slow (810 ms). Numerous small memory allocations was the culprit; pre-allocating memory lead to a 9x speed up (89 ms). <a href=https://gamesfromwithin.com/start-pre-allocating-and-stop-worrying>Start pre-allocating and stop worrying</a>!</p><h2 id=day-18>Day 18</h2><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life>Conwayâ€™s Game of Life</a> puzzle. Fun!</p><p>Part 2 of the puzzle required running the simulation for 1 billion times. This had to be short-circuited to get a result (in reasonable time). Printing the values revealed a repeating series; I vaguely remember cheating for this.</p><h2 id=day-19>Day 19</h2><p>Another ElfCode assembly puzzle. It involved understanding why assembly code was stuck in a loop. Basically itâ€™s trying to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization>factorize a large integer</a> inefficiently. Iâ€™d to replace this ElfCode segment with my own (Rust) function.</p><p>Learned about Rust modules and wrote a generic <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product>Cartesian product</a> function.</p><h2 id=day-20>Day 20</h2><p>Shortest distance path finding problem whose input is a very long <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>regular expression</a>. I didnâ€™t use a regex library as itâ€™s fairly easy to parse <em>by hand</em>. I implemented BFS for the shortest path reusing code from day 15. Realized many solutions were a lot simpler than mine; no path finding at all! ðŸ˜²</p><h2 id=day-22>Day 22</h2><p>Another Path finding problem with constraints and edge costs thatâ€™s harder; lots of rules and corner cases. I cheated for this; got inspirations from other solutions.</p><h2 id=day-23>Day 23</h2><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search>Nearest neighbour search</a> similar to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem>Closest Pair</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_empty_circle>Largest Empty Circle</a> (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry>Computational Geometry</a>) problems. Given a bunch of scattered spheres find the point such that itâ€™s closest to as many spheres as possible! ðŸ˜±</p><p>Tried brute force approach in vain. Solved by implementing <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree>Octree</a>. Very unsatisfying problem; despite coding it using integers and then with floats, an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error#Fencepost_error>off-by-one</a> error plagued my solution.</p><h2 id=day-24>Day 24</h2><p>Another turn-based war puzzle. Input was fairly complicated; most resorted to hard coding or using regular expression libraries. I used this opportunity to learn <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar>Parsing Expression Grammar</a> (PEG); it worked quite well! Thanks to <a href=https://leafo.net/guides/parsing-expression-grammars.html>Leafo</a> for introducing me to PEGs and <a href=https://pest.rs/>pest</a> for such a nice Rust implementation.</p><h2 id=day-25>Day 25</h2><p>Very satisfying <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_set_data_structure>Union-Find</a> problem I implemented using <code>HashMap</code>.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>I thoroughly enjoyed Advent of Code and learned a bunch of things along the way. Time permitting I might try another with a different tool.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>I might be wrong as a non-native speaker&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><p class=post-tags><span>Tagged:</span>
