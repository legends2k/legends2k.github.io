    <p>I completed <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> (AoC) 2018 today.  It’s a puzzle jam: yearly from Dec 1 to 25 a couple of puzzles are published everyday.  It’s <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?q=advent+of+code">popular</a> in geek circles; folks solve them in winter when business is dull.  Leaderboards are filled with people who solve them well within the day of their release.  There aren’t any restrictions on really when or how you solve these puzzles.</p>
<p>This piece shares my experience for the general computer programmer.</p>
<h1 id="code">Code</h1>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> to solve them but I won’t talk about it.  Here’s my repo:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/legends2k/advent-of-code/tree/master/2018">https://github.com/legends2k/advent-of-code/tree/master/2018</a></p>
<p>I’ve peppered the code with enough comments.  My commit logs usually capture context which can’t be added as comments.</p>
<p>I don’t like shortcuts like hard-coding puzzle inputs, keeping everything as strings, etc.  I tried to make the code fast, within reason, by being disciplined.  <strong>I’ve tried my best to make everything structured without <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a></strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/legends2k/advent-of-code/issues/new">Raise a bug</a> if you want to discuss something.</p>
<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<p>I motivated a couple of friends to join me in trying AoC around 2020 Feb.  <strong>Little did we know about the then-imminent pandemic</strong>.  In month from our start we’re deep into lock-downs, trying to procure grocery like paramilitary, setting up home offices and mini-schools, &hellip;</p>
<p>We agreed on completing one puzzle/week since we’re married with kids.  We thought it’s a reasonable target given these puzzles are solved in a day by so many.  How wrong were we! 🤣</p>
<p><strong>Nevertheless we ploughed whenever we got free time.</strong></p>
<h1 id="complete-em">Complete &rsquo;em!</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>How fast you complete the puzzles doesn’t matter much than the completion itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I’ve no shame in admitting it took 2½ years for me to complete what people do in 25 days.  I’m glad I completed them</strong>.  I didn’t have a regular schedule since life intervened, multiple times (some quite serious like death, relocating, etc. apart from the pandemic).  <strong>Whenever I found time, I solved small parts</strong> of a puzzle.  For instance, parsing the input itself was quite a challenge for <a href="#day-24">a puzzle</a>, I took a couple of days (an hour each) and solved it.</p>
<p>Maintaining perspective is important as always.  If I’m doing it for fun (and knowledge), what’s the point in trying to rush with a false deadline and pressurize myself?  The other extreme is to be so lax I lose interest and not complete.  While there’s nothing inherently wrong about this, if I repeat this for all my endeavours, I’m not going to get to any decent level of proficiency with any tool/concept with a bunch of unfinished projects.  Let aside mastery, I’d not have stories to tell or experiences to gain with that style of working.</p>
<p><strong>The balance is to complete the project at your own pace while preventing burning outs.</strong></p>
<h1 id="cheating-to-learn">Cheating to learn</h1>
<p>I completed <em>almost</em> all puzzles on my own.  IIRC, I cheated for 2-3 puzzles; looked up someone’s solution.  It’s important to know when:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cheated when all other options are exhausted and I realized I’m stuck long enough on one puzzle to lose interest in AoC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since many had solved AoC 2018 by now, I looked around the forums (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode">r/adventofcode</a>), scoured Wikipedia articles on a data structures / algorithms and discussed with friends.  When I realized all my usual options led me no where, I turned to someone’s solution.  I didn’t read them directly.  I usually ran them with my puzzle inputs and checked the correct answer against mine.  This helped me solve a puzzle without cheating.</p>
<p>Cheating instead of dropping the project altogether seems okay.  It’s okay if you’re doing it for learning; not where you’re proving your worth (e.g. exam).</p>
<h1 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h1>
<ol>
<li>Developer time is more valuable than machine time
<ul>
<li>Some solutions I encountered took 10x more time to solve the same puzzle, but with a simpler approach and perhaps considerably lesser dev time.  Moreover the actual time taken would be in minutes while I spent days to arrive at my optimized structured solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brute force solutions aren’t as bad as you might think
<ul>
<li>Sometimes they’re the optimal solution given other parameters</li>
<li>Optimized solutions have poor ROI at times [relates to (1)]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Excessive polishing is a waste of time
<ul>
<li>Know when to stop; understand the <em>Law of Diminishing Returns</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Code regularly periodically to avoid becoming a rusty developer; important as you become a senior
<ul>
<li>Corporates don’t care about your coding skills, only results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are many awesome programmers out there; learn and admire
<ul>
<li>I’m humbled by some solutions I encountered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="references">References</h1>
<p>After solving every puzzle, I’d fun going over solutions particularly of of Kanegae Gabriel and Andrew Gallant.  Respect and admiration for their work.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="rust">Rust</h1>
<p>I solved the puzzles in Rust.  It’s common for participants of AoC to pick a new language they wanted to get better at as the tool to solving the puzzles.  I’d been dabbling in Rust for more than 3 years now; done some <a href="https://github.com/legends2k/exercism/tree/master/rust">Rust exercises</a>; presented Rust sessions at my office.  Wanting to improve my <em>kata</em> is only part reason.  I knew <em>BurntSushi</em>, author of <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, has done AoC 2018; I wanted to compare my solutions to his after every puzzle completion ;)</p>
<p>I wrote functional style Rust using iterators wherever possible; it’s terse and sound coding.  Thanks to <a href="https://exercism.org/tracks/rust">Exercism.io</a> for teaching this early on.</p>

<p>So have I mastered Rust now?  Nope; it’s unneeded.  What’s important is now I’m confident enough to reach for Rust when it’s the right tool.  I’ve learned a bunch of concepts, techniques and standard library facilities I can employ in other projects.  I still have to learn about async, generics, etc. (unneeded for AoC).  It’s nice to have such backlogs to pursue.</p>
<h1 id="puzzles">Puzzles</h1>
<p>This is the last section for a couple of reasons: (a) it might be uninteresting to non-participants (b) contains spoilers.</p>
<p>Some puzzles were very dry; questions weren’t very good at explaining the problem<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.  This was frustrating since the rules weren’t properly laid out.</p>
<p>Here’re some notable puzzles and my learnings:</p>
<h2 id="day-7">Day 7</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)">Task scheduler</a> puzzle involving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph">dependency graph</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological sort</a>.  I solved this using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array">dynamic array</a> (<code>Vec</code>) instead of graph.  I did this by storing the dependants of a task, instead of its dependencies, and followed a push, instead of pull, model on task completions
.
Learned about authoring custom iterators in Rust.</p>
<h2 id="day-6">Day 6</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a> calculation problem.  Involved coding up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill">flood fill</a>-like algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="day-9">Day 9</h2>
<p>Computing hi-scores in a game between elves.  Wrote a <code>CircularList</code> using <code>Vec</code>.  Many solved this using <code>HashMap</code> but simple <code>Vec</code> is fairly versatile and under-used :)</p>
<h2 id="day-10">Day 10</h2>
<p>Points move around on an infinitely large canvas frame-by-frame; at a point in time they form a bunch of characters just for a frame.  I wrote a 2D visualization to solve this but others had done this just on terminal.  Though a command-line junkie, I totally missed this!  Given my interests in graphics and game programming this is perhaps expected?</p>
<p>Also I missed to realize the bounding box of the entire data keeps shrinking and reaches its minimum when the characters are formed!  A good learning exercise.</p>
<p><em>This was my longest hiatus</em>: resumed AoC after a 10 month break.</p>
<h2 id="day-11">Day 11</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table">Summed area table</a> problem which I realized only after solving it using a semi-brute force approach.</p>
<h2 id="day-12">Day 12</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">Genetic algorithm</a> puzzle on plant growth.  Had fun using bit flags.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation">Bit fiddling</a> is becoming a lost art these days; it isn’t esoteric once you understand the basic rules.</p>
<p>This is the start of puzzles where solutions can get stuck in infinite loops without a deterministic answer.  I’d to code bailing out of a loop if solutions didn’t change across iterations.</p>
<h2 id="day-13">Day 13</h2>
<p>Fun problem with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ASCII art</a> input of carts spread across a map.  We’ve to simulate carts moving around with a set of rules to find if there’s a collision eventually.  A very satisfying problem!</p>
<h2 id="day-15">Day 15</h2>
<p>Mini <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turns,_rounds_and_time-keeping_systems_in_games#Turn-based">turn-based</a> battle.  I gathered from the forums that many folks stopped AoC 2018 at this one.  It needs one to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem">shortest distance</a> path finding and meticulously follow a set of rules to find out the eventual victor.</p>
<p>I implemented BFS-based pathing.  The puzzle itself wasn’t hard (skill-wise) but involved a lot of busy work following complicated rules meticulously. Though I struggled quite a bit, I’m proud that I got this right without help.</p>
<p>Day 14 was the start of poor puzzle descriptions.  This one was even more complicated and unclear.</p>
<h2 id="day-16">Day 16</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">Virtual machine</a> implementation running ElfCode, a made-up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">instruction set</a>.  This was fun!  VM created here is used in later puzzles with more complications.  It roused the assembly programmer in me; it all came back!</p>
<h2 id="day-17">Day 17</h2>
<p>A simulation of liquid flow filling reservoirs.  This was quite hard.  My continuous approach was futile; resorted to a discrete approach and solved it.</p>
<p>Unlike most mine was an iterative solution but super slow (810 ms).  Numerous small memory allocations was the culprit; pre-allocating memory lead to a 9x speed up (89 ms).  <a href="https://gamesfromwithin.com/start-pre-allocating-and-stop-worrying">Start pre-allocating and stop worrying</a>!</p>
<h2 id="day-18">Day 18</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> puzzle.  Fun!</p>
<p>Part 2 of the puzzle required running the simulation for 1 billion times.  This had to short-circuited.  Printing the generated sequences showed a repetition of the results with periodicity; I vaguely remember cheating for this.</p>
<h2 id="day-19">Day 19</h2>
<p>Another ElfCode assembly puzzle.  It involved understanding why assembly code was stuck in a loop.  Basically it’s trying to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization">factorize a large integer</a> inefficiently.  We’d to replace this ElfCode segment with our own routines.</p>
<p>Used the opportunity to learned about Rust modules and wrote a generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product">Cartesian product</a> function.</p>
<h2 id="day-20">Day 20</h2>
<p>Shortest distance path finding problem whose input is a very long regular expression.  I’m glad I didn’t resort to any regex libraries as it’s fairly easy to parse it ‘by hand’.  I solved by implementing BFS for the shortest path algorithm reusing stuff from day 15.  Realized that many solutions were a lot simpler than mine; no path finding at all!</p>
<h2 id="day-22">Day 22</h2>
<p>Path finding problem with constraints and edge costs.  Another hard problem with lots of rules and corner cases like day 15.  I cheated for this by getting inspirations from other solutions.</p>
<h2 id="day-23">Day 23</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search">Nearest neighbour search</a> similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem">Closest Pair</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_empty_circle">Largest Empty Circle</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry">Computational Geometry</a>) problems.  Given a bunch of scattered spheres find the point such it’s closest to as many spheres as possible! 😱</p>
<p>Tried brute force approach in vain.  Solved by implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree">Octree</a>.  Very unsatisfying problem; despite coding it using integers then with floats, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error#Fencepost_error">off-by-one</a> error plagued my solution.</p>
<h2 id="day-24">Day 24</h2>
<p>Another turn-based war puzzle.  The input was fairly complicated and most resorted to hard coding their input and some used regular expression libraries.  I used this opportunity to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">Parsing Expression Grammar</a> (PEG) and it worked quite well!  Thanks to <a href="https://leafo.net/guides/parsing-expression-grammars.html">Leafo</a> for introducing me to PEGs and <a href="https://pest.rs/">pest</a> for such a nice Rust implementation.</p>
<h2 id="day-25">Day 25</h2>
<p>Very satisfying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_set_data_structure">Union-Find</a> problem I implemented using <code>HashMap</code>.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed Advent of Code and learned a bunch of things along the way.  Time permitting I might try another with a different tool.</p>
